## Abstract

<div align="justify"> Control of networked systems, comprised of interacting agents, is often achieved through modeling their underlying interactions. Constructing accurate models of such interactions–in the
meantime–can become prohibitive in many applications. Data-driven control methods avoid such complexity by directly synthesizing a controller from the observed data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm referred to as Data-driven Structured Policy Iteration (D2SPI), for synthesizing an efficient feedback mechanism that respects the sparsity pattern induced by the underlying interaction network. In particular, our algorithm uses temporary “auxiliary” links to boost information exchange for a (smaller) sub-network during the “learning phase.” We then proceed to show that the updated policy results in a stabilizing structured policy for the entire network. This is followed by stability and convergence analysis for the proposed distributed policies throughout the learning phase, exploiting “patterned set.” The performance of D2SPI is then demonstrated using representative simulation scenarios. </div> <br>
